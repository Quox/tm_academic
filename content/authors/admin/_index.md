Tomasz Mazurkiewicz received his M.Sc. degree (*summa cum laude*) in Information Technology with a specialization in cryptology from the Military University
of Technology, Warsaw, Poland, in 2014. He received a Ph.D. Eng. degree (*summa cum laude*) in Information and Communication Technology in 2021 from the
same University. His research interests are in logic synthesis and its application in FPGA-based electronic devices. His recent activities cover minimization methods of specific Boolean functions (called index generation functions), i.e., linear and non-disjoint functional decomposition. He is an author or co-author of several papers dealing with this topic, presented at international conferences such as ISCEng, MIXDES, ISMVL, and
FedCSIS.
