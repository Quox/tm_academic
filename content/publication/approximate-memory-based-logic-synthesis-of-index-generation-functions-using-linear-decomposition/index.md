abstract: Approximate logic synthesis has gained much interest lately due to the
  benefits in terms of the cost, i.e., energy and resource requirements. In this
  paper, we analyze the application of this emerging paradigm in the
  memory-based logic synthesis of incompletely specified index generation
  functions. In particular, we focus on the reduction of the number of input
  variables to minimize memory consumption. We present a heuristic method that
  combines the approximate approach and linear decomposition. Results obtained
  for some well-known index generation functions are evaluated using the exact
  approach.
